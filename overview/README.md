# Overview

**CMSIS-Compiler** provides software components that simplify retargeting of standard C run-time library functions.

Application code frequently uses standard C library functions, such as `fopen`, `fwrite`, `printf()`, `scanf()` and
others to perform input/output operations. These functions may as well be used in a multithreaded environment.

The structure of these functions in the standard C run-time library together with the retarget interfaces is:

Standard C library functions are platform independent and can be easily ported, while the low-level interfaces needs to
be tailored to the chosen platform. Generally low-level I/O functions serve to interact with the file system and a
serial interface, i.e. terminal. Multithreading support is available for applications that run on top of an RTOS kernel.

CMSIS-Compiler enables platform specific retargeting by providing software components that break down into the following interfaces:

- **File interface** that enables reading and writing files
- **STDIN interface** that enables standard input stream redirection
- **STDOUT interface** that enables standard output stream redirection
- **STDERR interface** that enables standard error stream redirection
- **OS interface** that enables multithread safety using an arbitrary RTOS

Using CMSIS-Compiler developers can retarget standard I/O streams and file operations to specific platform and enable
thread safe operations using RTOS interface.
