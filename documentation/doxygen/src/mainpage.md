# Overview {#mainpage}

**CMSIS-Compiler** provides software components that simplify retargeting of standard C run-time library functions.

Application code frequently uses standard C library functions, such as `fopen`, `fwrite`, `printf()`, `scanf()` and others to perform input/output operations. These functions may as well be used in a multithreaded environment.

The structure of these functions in the standard C run-time library together with the retarget interfaces is:

![Software Structure Overview](./images/overview.png)

Standard C library functions are platform independent and can be easily ported, while the low-level interfaces needs to be tailored to the chosen platform. Generally low-level I/O functions serve to interact with the file system and a serial interface, i.e. terminal. Multithreading support is available for applications that run on top of an RTOS kernel.

CMSIS-Compiler enables platform specific retargeting by providing software components that break down into the following interfaces:

 - File interface that enables reading and writing files
 - STDIN interface that enables standard input stream redirection
 - STDOUT interface that enables standard output stream redirection
 - STDERR interface that enables standard error stream redirection
 - OS interface that enables multithread safety using an arbitrary RTOS

The pages \ref rt_io and \ref rt_os explain the details about how retargeting is done using the provided components.

Using CMSIS-Compiler developers can retarget standard I/O streams and file operations to specific platform and enable thread safe operations using RTOS interface.

> **Note**
> - CMSIS-Compiler replaces and extends retargeting functionality previously provided as part of *Keil::ARM_Compiler* pack.
> - See [Migrating projects from CMSIS v5 to CMSIS v6](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/microcontrollers/project-migration-cmsis-v6) for a guidance on updating existing projects to CMSIS-Compiler.

## Supported Toolchains {#toolchains}

The CMSIS-Compiler component is available for the following toolchains:

 - [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded)
 - [Arm GNU Toolchain (GCC)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)

Support for IAR Compiler support will be added in a future revision of the CMSIS-Compiler.

## Access to CMSIS-Compiler {#compiler_access}

CMSIS-View is actively maintained in [**CMSIS-Compiler GitHub repository**](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Compiler) and is released as a standalone [**CMSIS-Compiler pack**](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-compiler-arm/versions/) in the [CMSIS-Pack format](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/index.html).
