\page rt_overview Overview

Application code frequently uses standard C library functions, such as \c fopen, \c fwrite, \c printf(), \c scanf() and others to perform 
input/output operations. These functions may as well be used is a multithreaded environment.

The structure of these functions in the standard C run-time library together with the retarget interfaces is:

Standard C library functions are platform independent and can be easily ported, while the low-level interfaces needs to be tailored
to the chosen platform. Generally low-level I/O functions serve to interact with the file system and a serial interface, i.e. terminal.
Multithreading support is available for applications that run on top of an RTOS kernel. CMSIS-Compiler enables platform specific
retargeting by providing software components that break down into the following interfaces:
- File interface that enables reading and writing files
- I/O interface to enable standard I/O stream retargeting (stderr, stdin, stdout)
- OS interface that enables multithread safety using an arbitrary RTOS

The pages \ref rt_io and \ref rt_os explain the details about how retargeting is done using the provided components.
