## Generating Software Pack

Some helper scripts are provided to generate the release artifacts from this repository.

### Doxygen Documentation

Generating the HTML-formatted documentation from its Doxygen-based source is done via

```bash
CMSIS-Comiler $ ./DoxyGen/gen_doc.sh
```

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:
 - Doxygen 1.9.2

### CMSIS-Pack Bundle

The CMSIS-Pack bundle can be generated with

```bash
CMSIS-Comiler $ ./gen_pack.sh
```

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:
 - Generated documentation (see above)
 - 7z (or GNU zip)
 - packchk
 - xmllint (optional)

### Version and Changelog Inference

The version and changelog embedded into the documentation and pack are inferred from the
local Git history. In order to get the full changelog one needs to have a full clone (not
a shallow one) including all release tags.

The version numbers are taken from the available tags. The shown release dates and
changelogs are one of:

1. For annotated tags the tagger date and the associated message is used.
2. For simple tags the committer date and message of the pointed-to commit is used.
